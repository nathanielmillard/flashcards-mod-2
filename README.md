# FlashCards Starter Kit

## Abstract

This is a project for Mod 2 of Turing's Front End Engineering program. Functionally it is a terminal flashcard game that allows the user to select an option, evaluates if they are correct, and eventually will calculate the guesses correct once they have guessed for every card in the deck.

Conceptually it's a project that highlights and expands upon student's understandings of test driven development; creating unit testing using mocha and chai, to build out classes based on the project description to interact with some existing code for game functionality. This demonstrates understanding of unit testing, as well as implementation of classes, methods on classes, and allowing multiple .js files and classes to interact.


## Setup
Clone down this repo
Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm test` in your terminal. You should have all tests passing.

Running `node index.js` from the root of your project should start your game.
